  <h2><b>Materials That You CAN Recycle</b></h2>
  <p>
Recycling is an extremely important step towards improving the state of our environment and cleaning the world around us. Everyday consumers in developed countries create a massive amounts of waste and the ways that are used to take care of it are not always the most environmentally friendly. Generally our waste in America, if not recycled, is either placed in a landfill or incinerated. Much of the waste we create is plastic which can take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose. Also the process of burning our trash can not only creates toxic fumes in the air we breath but it also creates greater amounts of greenhouse gases. By recycling, we can reduce the amount of waste flowing into landfills.
