  <h1>What is Recycling</h1>
    <p align=center>
      <em>"The separation and collection of materials that otherwise would be considered waste, the processing and remanufacturing of these items into new products, and the use of the recycled products to complete the cycle."
      </em>

  <h2><b>Climate Change</b></h2>
  <p>
Recycling is an extremely important step towards improving the state of our environment and cleaning the world around us. Everyday consumers in developed countries create a massive amounts of waste and the ways that are used to take care of it are not always the most environmentally friendly. Generally our waste in America, if not recycled, is either placed in a landfill or incinerated. Much of the waste we create is plastic which can take hundreds to thousands of years to decompose. Also the process of burning our trash can not only creates toxic fumes in the air we breath but it also creates greater amounts of greenhouse gases. By recycling, we can reduce the amount of waste flowing into landfills.

<h2>How Paper is Recycled</h2>

<div> 1. Paper is taken from the bin and deposited in a large recycling container along with paper from other recycling bins where contaminants such as plastic, glass or trash are removed.
<div> 2. Then, it’s taken to a recycling plant where it is separated into types and grades.
<div> 3. The separated paper is then washed with soapy water to remove inks, plastic film, staples and glue. The paper is put into a large holder where it is mixed with water to create ‘slurry’.
<div> 4. By adding different materials to the slurry, different paper products can be created, such as cardboard, newsprints or office paper.
<div> 5. The slurry is spread using large rollers into large thin sheets.
<div> 6. The paper is left to dry, and then it is rolled up ready to be cut and sent back to the shops.
